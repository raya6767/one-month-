    <p>hii babyyy i know i already posted you a paragraph and you’ll have to do so much readinggg im sorry myloveee buttt i wanna tell you happy one month again!! YAAYAYYAYAYA i cant believe i already spent 30 joyful days of my year with youuu 🤎 and inshallah ill spend all the days i have left with you. loving you has brought out the innermost happiness i had in me. i never thought anyone would ever be worthy enough to see it let alone bring it out but here you are woaaahhhh. i love every single thing about you from head to toe especially your dih baby 🔥 youre so perfect inside and out and if anything youre just so unreal baby i cant believe youre all mine. my personal favorite part about us is how we arent just lovers baby we’re best friends and soulmates and we have a bond that could represent every possible bond in this life and i wouldnt ever choose anyone or anything over this. i love how we can be freaky without it ever feeling weird and then suddenly switch to being soft and cute like nothing changed and it just feels right with you. i never feel like i have to fake anything or hide parts of myself because i know you would never see my flaws as flaws. i can be myself or whoever i choose to be in that moment and youll still love me the same or even more and that means everything to me. just so you know i rushed this a bittt thats why im not so shakespearey but baby that doesnt make this any less loving or from the heart. youre my world and everything i ever dreamed of and i wouldnt ask for anything better than this. i pray everyday that you stay by my side till my last breath because youre truly all i need in this world. thank you for being you and thank you for showing me what love truly is. you always make me feel worthy and there has never been a single moment where i thought otherwise all thanks to you mylove. i genuinely thank you from the bottom of my heart. there arent enough words to express my gratitude for you or even a quarter of my love but all the paragraphs i wrote you and will continue to write you are an attempt i hope they didnt fail but um yes baby thats it
